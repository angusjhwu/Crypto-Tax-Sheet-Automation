# Crypto Tax Sheet Automation
 
The objective is to completely automate the calculations of Canadian gains tax of digital assets (fiat on exchanges, and cryptocurrencies) using blockchain and trading APIs and exported trading data from exchanges.

## Motivation
With cryptocurrency being decentralized and global, each crypto service has their own transaction logging standard, which makes data keeping an hassel. Trading on crypto also involves conversion between many assets (fiat, native tokens, non-native tokens), periodic transactions (e.g. staking), and simultaneously using several services. This tool is an effort to simplify my personal trading and data logging of my hundreds to thousands of transactions.

## Features (to be added)
- Create a master ledger
- Classify types of wallet activity (trading, staking, transfering)
- Separate worksheets for tokens and blockchains
- Handles transactions from multiple exchanges and DEXs (e.g. Binance, Crypto.com App, Kraken, NDAX, etc.)
- Asset Dashboard
